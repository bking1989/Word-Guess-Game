# Word Guess Game: American Cities Edition

Hello, and welcome to the repository for my Word Guess Game. The actual game can be played [here](https://bking1989.github.io/Word-Guess-Game).

This is a project that was assigned to us in a coding boot camp, and it is meant to be an interactive game that uses JavaScript features like `for` loops, `document.onkeyup`, `indexOf`, and arrays in order to create a word guess game akin to hangman.

For my game's theme, I went with major U.S. cities, and the user (or you, in this case) is given a one of five choices via a random number generator that is coded into the JavaScript. From there, your answer is recorded via pressing a letter a key on the keyboard, then compared to the word's answer key. Regardless whether you successfully guess the word or not, the game will restart, so you get the chance to try again.
